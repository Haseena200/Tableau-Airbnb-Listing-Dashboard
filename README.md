## Questions
- Which cities have the highest number of Airbnb listings?

- Dashboard Design
- Created multiple worksheets for metrics like:
- Top cities by listing count
- Room type distribution
- Price trends by neighborhood
- Review counts per host/listing
- Availability heat maps
- Combined into a single interactive dashboard with filters for city, room type, and price range.
