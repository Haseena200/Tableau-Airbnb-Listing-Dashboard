# Tableau-Airbnb-Listing-Dashboard
This project uses data from Airbnb to understand how people rent homes in different cities. It shows important details like prices, types of rooms, availability, and reviews. The dashboard is made in Tableau and helps users see trends and make better decisionsâ€”whether they are guests, hosts, or business owners.
